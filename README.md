# DEMOUI
Demo UI  exercise in VueJS

An exercise in building an Access Level Form in VueJS using the Vue Material UI library.

## Requirements:
1. Create a 2 panel view. The left panel will contain a search-able table of the entries in accessLevels.json. The right panel will contain a form for editing selected entries in the left-side panel.
2. Any edits made to the entry in the right panel should be reflected in the left panel.
3. The left panel should contain a "Spotlight Search" that will filter rows in the left panel grid by matching the entered substring to Access Level Name, Reader Type or Reader Name fields in the grid.
